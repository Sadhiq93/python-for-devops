1. Import Flask


from flask import Flask
* This line imports the Flask class from the flask package.
* Flask is the main class used to create a web application.

2. Create a Flask Application Instance


app = Flask(__name__)
* This creates an instance of the Flask application.
* The argument __name__ tells Flask where to look for resources like templates and static files.
* Basically, it helps Flask know the location of your app.

3. Define a Route


@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
* @app.route('/') is a decorator that tells Flask:‚Ä®‚ÄúWhen someone visits the root URL (/), run the function below.‚Äù‚Ä®
* The function hello_world() runs whenever someone goes to your homepage.
* Whatever the function returns (in this case, the string 'Hello, World!') is what the user‚Äôs browser will display.

4. Run the App


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run("0.0.0.0")
* This means: only run the app if this file is executed directly (not imported as a module).
* app.run("0.0.0.0") starts the built-in Flask development server.
    * "0.0.0.0" tells Flask to make the app accessible on all network interfaces (so you can access it from your browser or even another device on the same Wi-Fi).
    * By default, it runs on port 5000 ‚Äî so your app will be at:‚Ä®‚Ä®

http://127.0.0.1:5000
or if you‚Äôre on the same network:


    * http://<your-computer‚Äôs-IP>:5000
    * ‚Ä®‚Ä®

üß† Optional Tip: Run the App
If your file is named myapp.py, run:


python3 myapp.py
Then open a browser and visit:


http://127.0.0.1:5000
You‚Äôll see:


Hello, World!
