Args and EnvVars
python installs some inbuild functions which can be used such as sys for operations.
args are used in code and can be passed at runtime.
-------
import sys
def sub(numb1, numb2):
        return numb2-numb1
numb1 = float(sys.argv[1])
numb2 = float(sys.argv[2])
operator = sys.argv[3]

if operator == "sub":
        result = sub(numb2, numb1)
        print(result)
--------
# python3 args.py 20 10 sub
10.0
-------------
Env variables:

used to store sensitive information or key value or labels to match with code modules.
command  to see # env

to export the variable use export

# export Team="dev"

and to use it in code import inbuilt os package
----------------
import os
import sys

def sub(numb1, numb2):
    return numb1 - numb2  # Clear subtraction: numb1 - numb2

# Read arguments from command line

numb1 = float(sys.argv[1])
numb2 = float(sys.argv[2])
operator = sys.argv[3]

# Perform operation
if operator == "sub":
    result = sub(numb1, numb2)
    print("Result:", result)

# Read environment variable
team_name = os.getenv("Team")
if team_name:
    print("This code is written by", team_name)
else:
    print("Environment variable 'Team' is not set.")
---------------
output

python3 env.py 10 5 sub
Result: 5.0
This code is written by dev
